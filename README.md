# Final Assignment Programming 1
For my final assignment I've decided to take a look wether there is a relation between lead in wastewater and violent crimes in the Netherlands? I got the idea from the [Lead-Crime Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead%E2%80%93crime_hypothesis)

# Requirements
 - numpy 1.23.3
 - holoviews 1.15.0
 - pandas 1.4.4
 - folium 0.13.0
 - hvplot 0.7.3

# Change Settings
The datafiles are loaded into the main script using the config.yaml file. Change the filepaths in this file to match the location of the data on your own pc before running the main script

# Running the script
I reccomend running the script in a Jupyter Notebook. Visual Studio Code does not dispay the graphs right.
